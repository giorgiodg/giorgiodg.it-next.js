## Giorgio Delle Grottaglie's one-page website

After the first attempt with [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/giorgiodg/giorgiodg-gatsbyjs) I have rebuilt my personal website through **Next.js**.
I got inspired by this minimal portfolio template called [leanfolio](https://github.com/magic-ike/leanfolio) which I eventually customized for my needs.

## Technologies / frameworks I am using

- Next.js
- ReactJS
- Netlify [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4a7eed75-ae18-43e0-abfe-72c262b0e1a6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/giorgiodg/deploys)

## Getting Started

### How to run it locally

npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giorgiodg/giorgiodg.it
cd giorgiodg.it
npm install
npm run dev
```

Yarn

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/giorgiodg/giorgiodg.it
cd giorgiodg.it
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Making Changes

- Go to `data/config.js` and replace the placeholder data with your own.

- To add a favicon to your site, put your `favicon.ico` file directly in the `public/` folder.
